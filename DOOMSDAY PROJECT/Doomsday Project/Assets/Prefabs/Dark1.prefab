  dialogue0:
  - Dark1-Welcome, Nameless One.
  - Dark1-What stands before you is your throne. Here, souls will kneel and you will
    judge.
  - Nameless-Right. . .
  - Nameless-And what's that on the back?
  - Dark1-When a soul leaves this plane, their emotion solidifies into one trinket.
  - Dark1-A mere memory of those who are not with us, of their life, their being.
  - Dark1-You shall collect them and add them to the pile on your right. Don't let
    them distract you.
  - Nameless-Why should they?
  - Dark1-. . .
  - Dark1-Whenever you are ready, sit on the throne and judge.
  - Dark1-Oh, to judge!
  - allowSpawn
  dialogue1:
  - Nameless-What was that?
  - Dark1-What do you mean?
  - Nameless-For a split second I felt a strong current of wind emanating from Harn.
  - Nameless-It asked something of me. I couldn't really comprehend it but I just.
    . .
  - Nameless-Dark images flashed before my eyes.
  - Dark1-That wasn't wind, Nameless One, but emotions. Inside these halls, emotions
    become tactile.
  - Dark1-What you experienced was the physical manifestation of what you humans
    call empathising.
  - Dark1Sad-Here, the process becomes so strong and pure that you can place yourself
    inside their own life and memories.
  - Dark1Sad-What you saw were probably memories of his distant self.
  dialogue2:
  - Nameless-So. . . when is God coming back exactly?
  - Dark1-. . .
  - Nameless-. . .
  - Nameless-Right.
  dialogue3:
  - Dark1Sad-Lift your spirits, Nameless One.
  - Dark1Sad-You humans are but a convoluted mess. Changing, evolving, but then again,
    returning to the same point in time.
  - Dark1-That place, whatever it is, is where you belong.
  - Dark1Sad-Is that not the truth, even if it is contained inside your little lie?
  - NamelessSad-Yeah, whatever.
  - NamelessSad-I'd appreciate if you stopped calling my life a fucking lie.
  - Dark1-Don't panic, Nameless One. Negation is the first phase.
  - Dark1-A phase many are unable to overcome.
  dialogue4:
  - Dark1-This one's been my favourite.
  - Nameless-Yeah, I bet.
  dialogue5:
  - Dark1Sad-. . .
  dialogue6:
  - Dark1Sad-Ah. . .
  - Dark1Sad-To judge. . .
