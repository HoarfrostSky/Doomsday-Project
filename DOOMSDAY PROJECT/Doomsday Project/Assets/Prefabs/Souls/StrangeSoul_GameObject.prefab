  dialogue:
  - Dark2-!
  - Nameless-Something wrong?
  - Dark2-This one feels. . . different?
  - Nameless-What do you mean?
  - Dark2Sad-Hm. . .
  - Dark2-Speak, lonely soul. Speak of your past.
  - Strange-Kahl.
  - Nameless-Huh?
  - Strange-Kahl am farre h.
  - Nameless-Hey guys, does this happen often?
  - Dark1Sad-These circumstances by themselves are not that common either.
  - Strange-Mo?
  - Nameless-What?
  - Strange-Ne?
  - NamelessSad-What the fuck are you saying?
  - Nameless-Am I not the one who is supposed to be asking questions anyway?
  - Nameless-Hey, who thought I was a good candidate for this job?
  - Dark1-No one.
  - Nameless-But I was chosen!
  - Nameless-You told me, or maybe it was the other one.
  - Dark2Sad-Selfishness overflows from your mouth when you speak, Nameless One.
  - Dark2-Yes, you were chosen.
  - Dark2-By chance.
  - Nameless-What?
  - Strange-Egnu?
  - Nameless-You shut up.
  - Dark2-A judgement must be fair, and so the judge was chosen by the fairest methods
    of all. Randomness.
  - "Nameless-That\u2019s bullshit. It\u2019s the other way around."
  - "Dark1-Don\u2019t bother, sibling. I\u2019m afraid the Nameless One does not
    see the full picture."
  - Dark1Sad-Pay attention to these words. This is not a judgement of the individual,
    but of humanity itself. A being that for so long has wraithed beneath the weight
    of time.
  - Dark1-For so long in fact, that they began to create a meaning for themselves.
  - Dark1-A morbid act, yet we let them be.
  - Dark1Sad-But we must not forget that a lie will always be a lie. More so in these
    halls.
  - Nameless-. . .
  - Dark1-You based your existence on a lie and therefore you must judge them according
    to that. Our methods of choosing you, however, are not tied to any lie.
  - Dark2-For we are absolute.
  - Dark1-We are the truth.
  - Dark2-And in the absolute, randomness is the fairest law of all.
  - Nameless-. . .
  - "Strange-Are thanj peiro. Er L kamenio eje palou m\u2019ou Thaia."
  - Strange-Mmmmmmmu.
  - NamelessSad-Whatever.
  - Nameless-Why do they speak like that?
  - Dark1-Every soul has its own language. What you are hearing is the language their
    soul speaks.
  - Nameless-Like. . . Taiwanese?
  - Dark1-No.
  - "Nameless-I don\u2019t think I get it."
  - Dark1Sad-Great.
  - Nameless-Do you know any translators?
  - Dark2-The language of the soul is unique. There are no translators.
  - "Dark2-The reason why you\u2019ve been able to understand them this far is because
    your minds and spirits are distorted by similar cultures and ideas. You all follow
    similar patterns, and thus recognise them in others."
  - "Dark1-What stands before you is the purest of souls. One that hasn\u2019t been
    corrupted by your lie."
  - cinematic
  - Nameless-What are they doing?
  - NamelessSad-Are pure souls supposed to do that?
  - Strange-Laaaaarrrvaaaa!
  - cinematic
  - Strange-Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarvaaaaa!
  - Nameless-Shut up!
  - cinematic
  - Strange-. . .
  - Dark1-. . .
  - Nameless-What? What is this feeling?
  - Dark2-Tell us, Nameless One.
  - Nameless-I feel something. Like a current of emotions emanating from them.
  - Dark1-Hang onto it.
  - Nameless-Should I?
  - "Dark1-It\u2019s the only chance you have at tresspassing the border of language."
  - Nameless-Why?
  - Dark1-Because this current you sense is created by something much, much stronger.
  - Dark1Sad-Emotion.
  - Dark2-Hang onto it, Nameless One.*bullying
  - Strange-. . .
  - Strange-. . .
  - Dark1-Well?
  - Dark2-What will it be?
  - NamelessSad-No. Wait, please.
  - "NamelessSad-Can\u2019t I just rest for a moment?"
  - "Dark1-Would it be fair, as you humans say? They didn\u2019t have any, it seems."
  - Dark2-Not even here.
  - NamelessSad-I. . .
  - Dark1-Speak your thoughts, Nameless One.
  - Strange-. . .
  - "NamelessSad-Let\u2019s get this over with."
