  - Harn-At last! I thought I would never see someone again.
  - Nameless-What?
  - Harn-Hi! Nice to meet ya!
  - Nameless-Hey!
  - Dark1-Kneel.
  - cinematic
  - HarnSad-My legs! They moved on their own!
  - Nameless-How did you do that?
  - "Dark1-It is the soul\u2019s will to be jugded, not ours."
  - "Dark2-Our role here is to supervise the ritual. Sometimes, a little guidance
    is needed. Isn\u2019t that right, Nameless One?"
  - Harn-Prick.
  - "Harn-Hey you! Don\u2019t pay attention to them. They\u2019re scary. You are
    no Nameless One. You are like me! My name is Harn and I\u2019ll be pleased to
    know yours."
  - Nameless-My name. . .
  - Harn-Is everything okay?
  - Harn-. . .
  - HarnSad-My god! Have you forgotten your own name?
  - "Nameless-What? No! I\u2019m not that old!"
  - Harn-Then what is it?
  - NamelessSad-Well.
  - "Harn-And what about that mask? Oh, trust me. If my brother were around, he would
    be screaming at the top of his lungs! That\u2019s horrible fashion sense, my
    guy."
  - "Harn-Heh. . . He\u2019d say something like that."
  - Dark1-Stop this nonsense.
  - Harn-Hey!
  - Dark2-Nameless One, it is vital for you to know that records are kept for most
    souls. Every action of interest, every deed, every sin.
  - Dark2-They are written in these walls, in every furniture, every window.
  - "Dark2Sad-Did you not hear the door cry out their past sorrows and memories?
    Maybe you\u2019ve not yet got used to its harrowing voice."
  - Nameless-Okay. . . and what exactly did the door tell you?
  - Dark2Sad-The spirit that kneels before you is the spirit of a thief.
  - cinematic
  - Harn-Spirit? What do you mean?
  - Nameless-Do you not know?
  - Harn-What am I supposed to know exactly?
  - Dark1-You are dead.
  - Nameless-Yeah, uh. . . I think there are better ways to say it.
  - Harn-Wait. Dead?
  - Dark1-The Judgement must continue.
  - Harn-No. No! Wait! I have so many questions!
  - Nameless-Well.
  - Nameless-Harn, right?
  - Harn-Uh, yeah.
  - Nameless-They said you were a thief. Is that correct?
  - Harn-They said so, yes.
  - NamelessSad-And is it true? Of what kind?
  - Harn-What do you mean?
  - Dark2Sad-That is what is written within your heart, the heart of someone who
    robbed another of their most precious belonging.
  - Nameless-What did you do?
  - Harn-Oh.
  - HarnSad-So that's what you mean.
  - HarnSad-I. . . yeah.
  - HarnSad-I guess this is it. No more running, huh?
  - cinematic
  - HarnSad-A thief. You could call it that.
  - Nameless-. . .
  - HarnSad-Indeed, I robbed her of many things. Her smile, her voice. I robbed her
    of happiness or dread.
  - HarnSad-And left her inside a horrible cage of memories and regret. My memories
    and regrets.*car_accident
  - Dark1-A sin is a sin.
  - Dark2-And thus, it must be judged as such.
  - Harn-So you are the one who must judge them, the others like me.
  - Nameless-Yeah. Seems like it.
  - Harn-I. . .
  - "HarnSad-I\u2019m sorry."
  - "HarnSad-I\u2019m so sorry for what I caused."
  - Nameless-Are you changing your mind?
  - HarnSad-No.
  - HarnSad-I guess I'm finally letting go.
  - "Harn-I wish I could say I hold no regrets, my guy, but that\u2019s just a lie.
    A bad one."
  - "Harn-But I\u2019m not worried. Whatever you choose, just know that I\u2019ll
    hold no grudges against you."
  - Harn-But what about those two back there? So fixed in being mysterious. Death
    this, Death that.
  - "Harn-Yet they don\u2019t even know that Death visited me long ago, when she
    took her under her wings."
  - Harn-In truth, the morning I woke up in that cold white bed, no one by my side,
    I realised I had also left with her. Nothing's been the same since then.
  - HarnSad-How could it be?
  - Dark2-What is your sentence, Nameless One?
  - Harn-May I ask for a final wish?
  - "Nameless-I don\u2019t think you can, but go for it."
  - Harn-Your name.
  - "Nameless-No. I can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry."
  - Harn-I understand. No need for apologies. It was a pleasure speaking with you.
    Nothing to hide. Honest words.
  - Harn-Do what you must.
