  - Nameless-What?
  - Harn-Hi! Nice to meet ya!
  - Nameless-Hey!
  - Dark1-Kneel.
  - cinematic
  - HarnSad-My legs! They moved on their own!
  - Nameless-How did you do that?
  - "Dark1-It is the soul\u2019s will to be jugded, not ours."
  - "Dark2-Our role here is to supervise the ritual. Sometimes, a little guidance
    is needed. Isn\u2019t that right, Nameless One?"
  - Harn-Prick.
  - "Harn-Hey you! Don\u2019t pay attention to them. They\u2019re scary. You are
    no Nameless One. You are like me! My name is Harn and I\u2019ll be pleased to
    know yours."
  - Nameless-My name. . .
  - Harn-Is everything okay?
  - Harn-. . .
  - HarnSad-My god! Have you forgotten your own name?
  - "Nameless-What? No! I\u2019m not that old!"
  - Harn-Then what is it?
  - NamelessSad-Well.
  - "Harn-And what about that mask? Oh, trust me. If my brother were around, he would
    be screaming at the top of his lungs! That\u2019s horrible fashion sense, my
    guy."
  - "Harn-He\u2019d say something like that."
  - Dark1-Stop this nonsense.
  - Harn-Hey!
  - Dark2-Nameless One, it is vital for you to know that records are kept for most
    souls. Every action of interest, every deed, every sin. They are written in these
    walls, in every furniture, every window.
  - "Dark2Sad-Did you not hear the door cry out their past sorrows and memories?
    Maybe you\u2019ve not yet got used to its harrowing voice."
  - Nameless-Okay. . . and what exactly did the door tell you?
  - Dark2Sad-The spirit that kneels before you is the spirit of a thief.
  - cinematic
  - Harn-Spirit? What do you mean?
  - Nameless-Do you not know?
  - Harn-What am I supposed to know exactly?
  - Dark1-You are dead.
  - Nameless-Yeah, uh. . . I think there are better ways to say it.
  - Harn-Wait. Dead?
  - Dark1-The Judgement must continue.
  - Harn-No. No! Wait! I have so many questions!
  - Nameless-Well.
  - Nameless-Harn, right?
  - Harn-Uh, yeah.
  - Nameless-They said you were a thief. Is that correct?
  - Harn-They said so, yes.
  - NamelessSad-And is it true? Of what kind?
  - Harn-What do you mean?
  - Dark2Sad-That is what is written within your heart, the heart of someone who
    robbed another of their most precious belonging.
  - Nameless-What did you do?
  - Harn-Oh.
  - HarnSad-I. . .
  - HarnSad-Yeah.
  - HarnSad-I guess this is it. No more running, huh?
  - cinematic
  - HarnSad-A thief. You could call it that.
  - Nameless-. . .
  - "HarnSad-I robbed her of her breath, her smile, her voice. I robbed her of happiness
    or dread. No longer could she see the sun or feel the breeze\u2019s embrace."
  - HarnSad-A cage. I left her inside a horrible cage of memories and regret.*car_accident
  - Dark1-A sin is a sin.
  - Dark2-And thus, it must be judged as such.
  - Harn-So you are the one who must judge them, the others like me.
  - Nameless-Yeah. Seems like it.
  - Harn-I. . .
  - "HarnSad-I\u2019m sorry."
  - "HarnSad-I\u2019m so sorry for what I caused."
  - Nameless-Are you changing your mind?
  - HarnSad-No.
  - "Harn-I\u2019m letting go."
  - "Harn-I wish I could say I hold no regrets, my guy, but that\u2019s just a lie.
    A bad one. No one who tells you that is making any sense. Remember that."
  - "Harn-But I\u2019m not worried. Whatever you choose, just know that I\u2019ll
    hold no grudges against you. But what about those two back there? So fixed in
    being mysterious. Death this, Death that."
  - "Harn-Yet they don\u2019t even know that Death visited me long ago, when she
    took her under her wings. In truth, the morning I woke up in that cold white
    bed, no one by my side, I realised I had also left with her."
  - Dark2-What is your sentence, Nameless One?
  - Harn-May I ask for a final wish?
  - "Nameless-I don\u2019t think you can, but go for it."
  - Harn-Your name.
  - "Nameless-No. I can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry."
  - Harn-I understand. No need for apologies. It was a pleasure speaking with you.
    Nothing to hide. Honest words.
  - Harn-Do what you must.
