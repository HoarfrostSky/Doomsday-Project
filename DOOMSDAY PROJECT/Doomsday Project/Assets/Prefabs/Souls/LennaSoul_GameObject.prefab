  - Dark1Sad-Excuse me?
  - LennaSad-Please. . . help me. . . ah. . .
  - "NamelessSad-What\u2019s the matter?"

  - cinematic
  - "Lenna-No. I saw him. I know it was him. That beard, that ponytail. . . I\u2019m
    sure it was him."
  - Lenna-It had to be Hayure.
  - NamelessSad-Wait. Hayure?
  - Nameless-The creepy guy?
  - Lenna-Creepy?
  - LennaSad-Oh no.
  - LennaSad-Oh my god. What did he do?
  - "NamelessSad-He tried to kill me. I don\u2019t blame him though."
  - "LennaSad-Fuck! I\u2019m sorry. He just. . . Wait."
  - Lenna-Who are you?
  - Dark1-That does not matter.
  - NamelessSad-Oh, shut up, mystery guy.
  - "NamelessSad-This is Doomsday. I\u2019m the judge."
  - LennaSad-What?
  - LennaSad-I mean. . . Are you God himself?
  - Nameless-No. There is silence in the house of God. He is nowhere to be found.
  - LennaSad-Did he forsake us?
  - Nameless-I believe so.
  - LennaSad-And who are those guys?
  - "Nameless-I don\u2019t know."
  - LennaSad-How can you not know?
  - Nameless-. . .
  - NamelessSad-. . .
  - "NamelessSad-Look. I\u2019m just some guy."
  - NamelessSad-Like you, like everyone else who came through here.
  - "NamelessSad-I can\u2019t keep lying to others. I can\u2019t keep lying to myself."
  - NamelessSad-. . .
  - "NamelessSad-I\u2019m tired."
  - "NamelessSad-I\u2019m so tired, Lenna."
  - Lenna-How do you know my name?
  - NamelessSad-That door behind you told me.
  - Lenna-The door told you?
  - NamelessSad-It told me everything.
  - "Dark1-It seems he\u2019s finally begun to understand it."
  - Dark2-The language of pain and longing. The words these halls speak.
  - "NamelessSad-I can\u2019t keep doing this."
  - Dark2Sad-You must.
  - NamelessSad-No.
  - Dark2Sad-You must question them.
  - NamelessSad-But I already know everything about her.
  - Dark1Sad-To assume such a thing is to lie to oneself.
  - "NamelessSad-Yeah, that\u2019s basically what I\u2019ve been doing since I came
    here. How the fuck did you notice so quickly?"
  - Dark1-Ask them, then.
  - Dark1-Learn her truth.
  - "Dark1-And possibly, in her truth, you\u2019ll find yours."
  - cinematic
  - NamelessSad-God. . .
  - NamelessSad-. . .

  - "Nameless-Are you after Hayure for the crimes he\u2019s commited?"
  - LennaSad-. . .
  - LennaSad-No.
  - Nameless-So what for?
  - "LennaSad-I don\u2019t know what he told you or what you saw in him, but it was
    a lie."
  - "Dark1-Memories don\u2019t lie."
  - LennaSad-They do! They always do!
  - Lenna-Tell me, judge, do you remember your family?
  - Nameless-Yes.
  - Lenna-And what about the moments you shared with your friends?
  - Nameless-Yes.
  - Lenna-Are those memories not lies themselves? It is not the events that happen,
    but the emotions we experience what shape our memories and solidify them within
    us.
  - Lenna-Memories are but stories told by our own emotions.
  - Nameless-Why are you telling me this? To justify his killings?
  - Lenna-Killings?
  - Lenna-Hayure is not a killer.
  - Dark1Sad-Lies, once again.
  - Lenna-I know what happened!
  - "Lenna-If this really is the Last Judgement you speak of, look into the deepest
    abyss of my soul as you\u2019ve done with the others.*truth"
  - "Lenna-I don\u2019t know where he is now, nor I care."
  - Lenna-I just want to be with him. To comfort him. To help him understand himself.
  - "Lenna-And together. . . we\u2019ll find John. Be it in heaven or hell. We\u2019ll
    look at the brightest of stars in the firmament and fly towards it."
  - LennaSad-Together, us three, fading past the veil of night.
  - LennaSad-Ah. . .
  - LennaSad-Seems nice.
  - LennaSad-. . .
  - Lenna-Send me with him.
  - "Dark1-Do not pay attention to her words, Nameless One. Her soul must be judged
    according to her actions only, not others\u2019."
  - NamelessSad-. . .
  - cinematic
  - LennaSad-Please, send me with him, wherever he may be.
  - "Lenna-I\u2019m ready."
