  dialogue:
  - Nameless-Welcome to the Last Halls, sorrowful soul.
  - "Bretta-I\u2019ve been wandering. . . for so long."
  - "Bretta-I\u2019m dead, huh?"
  - Nameless-It seems so, yes.
  - Bretta-What killed me?
  - Dark1-Fate.
  - Bretta-I figured as much.
  - Bretta-Wait. Oh my god.
  - BrettaSad-Is Colin okay?
  - Nameless-Who?
  - cinematic
  - BrettaSad-My son. I mean. . . Oh god. What happened to me? Is he alright?
  - Dark2-Your son. . .
  - Nameless-No.
  - "Dark2-What\u2019s the matter, Nameless One?"
  - "Nameless-Let me talk with her. Don\u2019t interfere."
  - Nameless-May I ask for your name, painful soul?
  - "Bretta-I\u2019m Bretta."
  - "Nameless-Right. Bretta. . . let\u2019s try to calm down for a moment."
  - Nameless-No soul named Colin has passed through these halls.
  - "Bretta-Does that mean he\u2019s fine?"
  - "Nameless-Exactly. Can\u2019t you see you are the only dead one here?"
  - Bretta-What happened to me?
  - Dark1Sad-That matters not.
  - Bretta-I want to know.
  - Dark2-So many want to, but it is not our duty to discuss that. You are here to
    be judged, Bretta.
  - Bretta-. . .
  - cinematic
  - NamelessSad-Here we go again.
  - Nameless-Well, Bretta, tell me about you. Experiences, regrets, sins. Only the
    interesting parts, please.
  - "Bretta-I don\u2019t know what to tell you, God, or whoever you are. I'm sure
    you\u2019ve already heard this a hundred times."
  - "Nameless-I don\u2019t mind hearing it again."
  - "Bretta-I guess I\u2019ll start by the beginning."
  - Nameless-Is it really necessary?
  - Bretta-The beginning is always necessary.
  - Nameless-. . .
  - Bretta-Well.
  - Bretta-When I was a child I lived a strict parenting. The grandiose dreams of
    a little girl were no more than mere words of innocence. But oh. . . what dreams.
    . .
  - Bretta-I always dreamed of exploring the unknown, of dangerous adventures. I
    dreamed of entering a dark cave and exiting with my hands full of gold and jewels.
  - "Bretta-I dreamed of traveling the skies, swiming across the clouds at dusk.
    I\u2019d soak in its beauty and become one with the approaching firmament."
  - Bretta-And indeed, I ended up being just another distant star. So far from others.
    So far from everything.
  - Bretta-I grew to accept that fact, to understand it.
  - Bretta-Everything seemed so distant.
  - BrettaSad-And in that distance, I lost myself.
  - Nameless-What happened?
  - BrettaSad-. . .
  - BrettaSad-I hated them all.
  - BrettaSad-Life was so dull, so uninteresting.
  - "Bretta-I couldn\u2019t stand the image of someone enjoying themselves. How?
    What are they seeing in something so mundane, so repetitive, so full of hate
    and sorrow?"
  - Bretta-Could they see something I did not or was I the only one who could?
  - "Dark1-It\u2019s the only true constant in the lie of life, no matter who passes
    that door."
  - Bretta-What do you mean?
  - Dark1-Sorrow. Fear. Longing.
  - Dark2-Happiness. Determination. Pride.
  - Dark1Sad-All of them are tied together by pain.
  - Dark1Sad-For pain is the cement of life.
  - Nameless-Is that what you think, you two?
  - "Dark1-We don\u2019t have any opinion on the matter, Nameless One."
  - Dark2-It just is.
  - Bretta-I killed a guy once.
  - cinematic
  - Nameless-Excuse me?
  - "Bretta-I opened a special hole in my heart to bury her. Every morning she would
    try to escape, and every morning I wouldn\u2019t let her, because it would hurt
    even more than what it already did."
  - Bretta-. . .
  - BrettaSad-I made some pretty bad choices. I did. All of it was me.
  - Bretta-I became arrogant and spiteful and soon I was left wandering the streets.
    Ah, the cold nights, the indiferent stares. Indeed, I had achieved my dream,
    in a way.
  - Bretta-I became the most distant of stars.
  - Nameless-. . .
  - Bretta-I was so confused, so angry at everything. Eventually, anger turned to
    sorrow, the same one I felt many years before and then, I understood.
  - Bretta-Those two that stand beneath you are right. Pain is the only constant
    in life.
  - Bretta-Everything else is temporary. It all vanishes as soon as it appears.
  - BrettaSad-. . .
  - BrettaSad-There was this guy, who lived with us in a small community in the outskirts
    of the city. John.
  - "BrettaSad-It wasn\u2019t official, but John behaved as the leader of the group
    and everyone accepted it. Not me. He was always trying to fill us with false
    hope, to convince us to believe in a better tomorrow."
  - "Bretta-Couldn\u2019t he just leave us to rot?"
  - "Bretta-Couldn\u2019t he see that our obligation as human beings was to suffer?"
  - "Bretta-But there was something that I couldn\u2019t stand even more than any
    of that. Can you guess?"
  - NamelessSad-You tell me.
  - "Bretta-He loved to go out and explore. He\u2019d always find something in some
    forgotten place. Nothing useful, mind you. It was just a hobby."
  - Bretta-Everyone just let him do his thing, and yet, it drove me mad.
  - Nameless-Why is that?
  - Bretta-Guess.
  - Nameless-. . .
  - Bretta-So one day I suggested going out with him to explore. On the way to our
    destination, I just got him down on the ground and. . . strangled him.
  - BrettaSad-I never came back to that group. I was alone, once again.
  - Dark1-Nameless One?
  - Bretta-But then, he appeared.*dreams_of_adventure
  - "BrettaSad-And now fear strangles my heart once more. I fear Colin won\u2019t
    be able to experience all the magic this world has in store for him."
  - "BrettaSad-If whatever happened to me also affected him, I fear he will leave
    this world the same way I did. In truth, that is what I fear the most. There
    can\u2019t be another one like me."
  - BrettaSad-Do you think he hates me, the same way I hated my family?
  - Nameless-. . .
  - Dark1-Enough time has been given.
  - Dark2-The judgement must continue.
  - BrettaSad-. . .
  - BrettaSad-This is it then.
  - BrettaSad-I guess not all stories have a proper ending anyways. After all, we
    are more than just stories.
  - Bretta-Right?
