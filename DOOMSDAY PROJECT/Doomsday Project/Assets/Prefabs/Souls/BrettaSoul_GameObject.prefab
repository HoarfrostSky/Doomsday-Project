  dialogue:
  - Nameless-Welcome to the Last Halls, sorrowful soul.
  - "Bretta-I\u2019ve been wandering. . . for so long."
  - "Bretta-I\u2019m dead, huh?"
  - Nameless-It seems so, yes.
  - Bretta-What killed me?
  - Dark1-Fate.
  - Bretta-I figured as much.
  - Bretta-Wait. Oh my god.
  - BrettaSad-Is Colin okay?
  - Nameless-Who?
  - cinematic
  - BrettaSad-My son. I mean. . . Oh god. What happened to me? Is he alright?
  - Dark2-Your son. . .
  - Nameless-No.
  - "Dark2-What\u2019s the matter, Nameless One?"
  - "Nameless-Let me talk with her. Don\u2019t interfere."
  - Nameless-May I ask for your name, painful soul?
  - "Bretta-I\u2019m Bretta."
  - "Nameless-Right. Bretta. . . let\u2019s try to calm down for a moment."
  - Nameless-No soul named Colin has passed through these halls.
  - "Bretta-Does that mean he\u2019s fine?"
  - "Nameless-Exactly. Can\u2019t you see you are the only dead one here?"
  - Bretta-What happened to me?
  - Dark1Sad-That matters not.
  - Bretta-I want to know.
  - Dark2-So many want to, but it is not our duty to discuss that. You are here to
    be judged, Bretta.
  - Bretta-. . .
  - cinematic
  - NamelessSad-Here we go again.
  - Nameless-Well, Bretta, tell me about you. Experiences, regrets, sins. Only the
    interesting parts, please.
  - "Bretta-I don\u2019t know what to tell you, God, or whoever you are. I'm sure
    you\u2019ve already heard this a hundred times."
  - "Nameless-I don\u2019t mind hearing it again."
  - "Bretta-I guess I\u2019ll start by the beginning."
  - Nameless-Is it really necessary?
  - Bretta-The beginning is always necessary.
  - Nameless-. . .
  - Bretta-Well.
  - Bretta-Ah, my parents were very strict when I was younger. To them, the grandiose
    dreams of a little girl were no more than mere words of innocence, but oh. .
    . what dreams. . .
  - Bretta-I always dreamed of exploring the unknown, of dangerous adventures. I
    dreamed of entering a dark cave and exiting with my hands full of gold and jewels.
  - "Bretta-I dreamed of traveling the skies, swiming across the clouds at dusk.
    I\u2019d soak in its beauty and become one with the approaching firmament."
  - Bretta-Heh.
  - Bretta-And indeed, I ended up being just another distant star. So far from others.
    So far from everything.
  - Bretta-I grew to accept that fact, to understand it.
  - Bretta-Everything seemed so distant.
  - BrettaSad-And in that distance, I lost myself.
  - Nameless-What happened?
  - BrettaSad-. . .
  - BrettaSad-I hated them all.
  - BrettaSad-Life was so dull, so uninteresting.
  - "Bretta-I couldn\u2019t stand the image of someone enjoying themselves. How?
    What are they seeing in something so mundane, so repetitive, so full of hate
    and sorrow?"
  - Bretta-Could they see something I did not or was I the only one who could?
  - "Dark1-It\u2019s the only true constant in the lie of life, no matter who passes
    that door."
  - Bretta-What do you mean?
  - Dark1-Sorrow. Fear. Longing.
  - Dark2-Happiness. Determination. Pride.
  - Dark1Sad-All of them are tied together by pain.
  - Dark1Sad-For pain is the cement of life.
  - Nameless-Is that what you think, you two?
  - "Dark1-We don\u2019t have any opinion on the matter, Nameless One."
  - Dark2-It just is.
  - Bretta-I killed a guy once.
  - cinematic
  - Nameless-Excuse me?
  - Bretta-You see, the time came when I opened a special hole in my heart to bury
    myself, the little girl who dreamed of treasures and poetic dusks.
  - "Bretta-Every morning she would try to escape, and every morning I wouldn\u2019t
    let her, because it would hurt even more than what it already did."
  - Bretta-. . .
  - BrettaSad-I made some pretty bad choices. I did. All of it was me.
  - Bretta-I became arrogant and spiteful and soon I was left wandering the streets.
    Ah, the cold nights, the indiferent stares. Indeed, I had achieved my dream,
    in a way.
  - Bretta-I became the most distant of stars.
  - Nameless-. . .
  - Bretta-I was so confused, so angry at everything. Eventually, anger turned to
    sorrow, the same one I felt many years before and then, I understood.
  - Bretta-Those two that stand beneath you are right. Pain is the only constant
    in life.
  - Bretta-Everything else is temporary. It all vanishes as soon as it appears.
  - BrettaSad-. . .
  - BrettaSad-There was this guy, who lived with us in a small community in the outskirts
    of the city. John.
  - "BrettaSad-It wasn\u2019t official, but John behaved as the leader of the group
    and everyone seemed to accept it. Not me."
  - BrettaSad-He was always trying to fill us with false hope, to convince us to
    believe in a better tomorrow.
  - "Bretta-Couldn\u2019t he just leave us to rot?"
  - "Bretta-Couldn\u2019t he see that our obligation as human beings was to suffer?"
  - "Bretta-But there was something that I couldn\u2019t stand even more than any
    of that. Can you guess?"
  - NamelessSad-You tell me.
  - "Bretta-He loved to go out and explore. He\u2019d always find something in some
    forgotten place. It seemed like a mere hobby to everyone."
  - Bretta-At that time, to me, it was like being stabbed in the chest.
  - Nameless-Why is that?
  - Bretta-Guess.
  - Nameless-. . .
  - Bretta-The day came when rage finally took hold of my body. I offered myself
    to go with him and he accepted. I can't remember what the exact reason was, what
    made me actually do it.
  - BrettaSad-But on the way to our destination, I just got him down on the ground
    and. . .
  - BrettaSad-Damn. I put my hands around his neck and just kept chocking him with
    all my strength. After a while. . . his body was still there, but John was nowhere
    to be found.
  - BrettaSad-I knew it wasn't the right thing to do but I did it anyway. I didn't
    care.
  - BrettaSad-I never came back to that group after that. When my senses returned,
    I couldn't face what I had done.
  - BrettaSad-I was alone, once again.
  - Dark1-Nameless One?
  - Bretta-But then, he appeared.*dreams_of_adventure
  - "BrettaSad-And now fear strangles my heart once more. I fear Colin won\u2019t
    be able to experience all the magic this world has in store for him."
  - BrettaSad-If whatever happened to me also affected him, I fear he will leave
    this world the same way I did. In truth, that is what I fear the most.
  - "BrettaSad-There can\u2019t be another one like me."
  - BrettaSad-Do you think he hates me, the same way I hated my family?
  - Nameless-. . .
  - Dark1-Enough time has been given.
  - Dark2-The judgement must continue.
  - BrettaSad-. . .
  - BrettaSad-This is it then.
  - BrettaSad-I guess not all stories have a proper ending anyways. After all, we
    are more than just stories.
  - Bretta-Right?
