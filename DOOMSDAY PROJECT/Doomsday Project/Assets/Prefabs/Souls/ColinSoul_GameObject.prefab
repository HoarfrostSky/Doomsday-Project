  - Nameless-A child?
  - Colin-Hi!
  - Colin-I'm lost. Do you know the way out of here?
  - Nameless-Oh, man.
  - Nameless-You are, in fact, in the right place.
  - Colin-Oh.
  - Colin-What does that mean?
  - Dark2-This child is strange.
  - Dark2-He does not feel fear, like the others before him. A strange emotion opaques
    the rest.
  - Dark2Sad-Hm. . .
  - Dark2-Joy?
  - Nameless-What? Joy? Here?
  - NamelessSad-Seems like a bad joke.
  - cinematic
  - "Colin-Hey! I\u2019m right here!"
  - Nameless-Yeah, yeah. I know.
  - Nameless-. . .
  - NamelessSad-Hey, you two. What the fuck am I supposed to ask a child?
  - Dark1-Ask them about their life.
  - NamelessSad-What life?
  - Dark1Sad-Judge them, then.
  - NamelessSad-Argh.
  - Nameless-Hey kid, tell me about you.
  - Colin-Alright!
  - Colin-I love pancakes.
  - Colin-I really, really love them.
  - Colin-I also like strolling through the park. I do it a lot with my mom.
  - Colin-Hm. . .
  - Dark1-Nameless One, remember that your time is not infinite. There are still
    so many souls left.
  - Nameless-. . .
  - Colin-My favourite color is blue!
  - NamelessSad-. . .
  - "Nameless-That\u2019s great, kid."
  - "Colin-I don\u2019t like reading!"
  - Nameless-Hey! Reading is nice.
  - "Colin-It\u2019s boring. Sometimes there are so many letters that my head hurts."
  - Dark2-Nameless One, we must. . .
  - Nameless-What books have you read?
  - Colin-Not many. The ones I could find.
  - Nameless-Yeah, I mean, what were they about?
  - "Colin-Oh, I don\u2019t know."
  - Nameless-Huh?
  - "Colin-I just opened them and scrolled through the pages. It\u2019s boring. There\u2019s
    nothing there but words."
  - "Nameless-Yeah, that\u2019s what books are."
  - Nameless-Wait. Do you even know how to read?
  - Colin-Nope.
  - NamelessSad-That explains it.
  - "Nameless-Didn\u2019t your parents teach you how to read?"
  - "Colin-My mom didn\u2019t."
  - Nameless-And your father?
  - "Colin-I don\u2019t have one."
  - NamelessSad-Oh. Sorry.
  - "Colin-It\u2019s okay! Don\u2019t be sad."
  - Nameless-Did you go to school?
  - Colin-Nope.
  - NamelessSad-. . .
  - Nameless-Are you not scared of being here? A strange place?
  - Colin-Why should I be scared?
  - "Nameless-I mean, I don\u2019t know. If I were in your place, I\u2019d be shitting
    my pants, man."
  - "Colin-But you aren\u2019t scared at all, right?"
  - NamelessSad-. . .
  - NamelessSad-No.
  - Colin-See?
  - cinematic
  - Dark1Sad-. . .
  - NamelessSad-. . .
  - "Nameless-Tell me about your life, kid. Not your likes or dislikes. Trust me,
    I\u2019d love to talk endlessly with you about them, but we are kind of in a
    hurry."
  - "Colin-Oh, it\u2019s okay. I understand."
  - Nameless-Wait.
  - "Nameless-Before that, please, I hope this doesn\u2019t sound too strange."
  - Colin-Yes?
  - Nameless-Would you mind sharing some of your joy with me?
  - Colin-How can I do that?
  - Nameless-Smile.
  - Colin-Okay!*colin_past
  - "Colin-I want to tell her about this place I found all by myself. I even came
    across some great people too! She\u2019ll probably get mad at me, but I don\u2019t
    care."
  - "Colin-It\u2019s been amazing!"
  - Colin-How many places like these are out there in the world. . .
  - Colin-Waiting to be found by me! Ha!
  - Nameless-. . .
  - "Nameless-I\u2019m glad you had fun."
  - Colin-Yeah!
  - Nameless-I can help you get out of here, if you want to.
  - "Colin-That\u2019s nice."
  - NamelessSad-I can bring you to her.
  - Dark1Sad-. . .
  - Nameless-Do you have any last wish?
  - Colin-A wish? Can I do that?
  - Nameless-Yeah.
  - Colin-Oh! Oh! Hm. . .
  - "Colin-I know! I\u2019d love to see my friend once more. I still want to give
    him a chocolate pancake. They\u2019re delicious!"
  - NamelessSad-Understood.
  - NamelessSad-Can I wish for something too?
  - Colin-Yeah.
  - NamelessSad-Would you give me your name?
  - Colin-Colin!
  - Nameless-Goodbye, Colin. It was a pleasure speaking with you.
  - Colin-Thanks. You too!
